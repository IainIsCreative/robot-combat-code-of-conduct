# [EVENT] Code of Conduct

As organisers and helpers of this event, and in the general interest of the robot building and fighting community, we are committed to providing a welcome, friendly, and helpful environment for all participants at our event. We are happy to have participants regardless of experience, age, gender and gender indentity, religious background, race, ethnicity, nationality, body size, disability, or other similar characteristics. We want to make our environment safe and welcoming for all participants. We will not tolerate any harassment to any participants. [EVENT ORGANISATION] take these violations of conduct seriously and will be dealt with appropriately.

All teams, persons, workers, volunteers and staff must adhere to the code of conduct in an effort to make this event as safe and welcoming as possible.

### Conduct in regards to Humans

- **Be welcome and courteous to each other.** We aim to be welcoming to combatants, new and experienced, to the sport and wish them to participate in future events as well.
- **If another person or team requires assitance, try to help if you can.** Helping other teams can alleviate a lot of stress and can ensure they can stay in the contest. This also makes a positive impact on the community.
- **Avoid using negative terms or phrases.** There are no perfect designs in robot combat, but that does not mean there are bad ideas. Be helpful and encouraging on someone's work, and help their ideas become better ones. Inspire them to keep going in this sport.
- **Avoid sexualised language or behaviour.** We aim not to make people feel uncomfortable as this can make them wish to exit this event and possibly the sport. We don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable of their gender, orientation, experience or other sexual aspect.
- **Sexist, racist, ableist and other discriminative or offensive remarks are not allowed.** We want to welcome more people to compete at our event and the sport as a whole, and not let them feel threatened or offended by what someone has said in terms of a charateristic that they have.
- **Unhelpful or mocking commentary of another participant is not allowed.** This included on how a person's machine is built or designed, or how a participant or team is different in a derogatory fashion.
- **Harassment of a person, persons or teams are not allowed.** Continuous pestering of people can drive people away from the event or the sport as a whole. If a person does not welcome your interaction and tells you to stop, **you will stop immediately.**
- **Threatening participants, executed or not, are forbidden.** Threatening harm to a person and can be considered one of the highest offences, and will be taken seriously. These include, but are not limited to, threats of:
  - Physical violence
  - Murder
  - Sexual harassment or assault
  - Other means of threats that are heinous
- **Unprofessional or unethical behaviour is not allowed.** Interactions that are unwelcome and seen as unprofessional, including those from teams, organisers, and volunteers, will be taken seriously in order to make this event the best it can be.

### Conduct in regards to Robots

- **All machines are to be given proper respect and care when brough to an event.** Fighting robots are dangerous, and should be treated with proper respect. Misuse or abuse of a robot is considered a violation.
- **Any and all robots that you have brought for participation must be checked before competing.** This includes robots that are spares, or robots that house spare parts for a machine you're competing with. If your robot is switched for a spare but hasn't been given safety checks counts as a violation.
- **All robots must not be operational outside an active or fighting area.** Robots cannot be allowed to be left powered on outside an area they can be activated. This can cause potential harm to people present.
- **Vandalism of robots is forbidden.** If you deface a robot by placing a sticker, graffiti, or other means of vandalism without prior knowledge or consent, counts as a violation.
- **Keep to your own working space.** All competitors should have equal working space, and should be allowed to work in the given area. You should not have your tools, robot, or other materials spread over into their space.
- **Movement of robots that aren't yours, without permission or knowledge thereof, is forbidden.** Moving or misplacing a robot or parts of another person's robot should not happen unless permission is given and is necessary.
- **Robots, of all weight classes, are not to be treated like toys.** These machines are dangerous and can cause serious harm, even death. Robots should not be used in unsafe environments for any reason.
- **Adjusting, changing, or removing anything from someone's robot without prior consent or knowledge is not allowed.** This can effect the team and the robot, and may even be considered tampering.
- **Other means of causing disrespect or damage to other team's robots and parts is considered a vioolation.** As above, this can be considered tampering with a machine that is not yours.

### Conduct in regards to Health and Safety

- **All participants must exercise health and safety when operating and maintaining robots.** Experienced competitors must lead by example and even teach proper health and safety to newer, inexperienced competitors in an effort to promote a happy and safe environment.
- **All LiPo batteries under charge must be safely placed in a LiPo sack and be attended to while charging.** No batteries should be left unattended or outside of a lipo sack when charging. This is a fire hazard.
- **All power tools, must be switched off when no longer being used or attended.** These include tools such electric drills, multitools, and soldering irons.
- **Any sharp tools or objects must be placed away when not in use.** Do not leave sharp objects exposed or left around when not in use. This can cause serious injury.
- **When a robot is operating in an active area or fighting arena, participants must not step inside the area.** There should be no reason for a human to be inside an active area, including for turning the robot off. This must be done at the entry gate. Only enter such an area when no machines are active.
- **Misusing, abusing, and throwing tools and objects, of any size, whether to cause harm or not, is completely forbidden.** This can cause unease and may put participants at risk. We cannot allow people to feel that they are in danger at the event.

### Consequences

Should any of the above points be violated, an event organiser or worker for the event must be notified immediately in order to execute the appropriate action for what the participant has failed to do. The event organiser may also give these sanctions at their discretion.

These may include, but are not limited to:

- Disqualification from the contest taking place, regardless of place in the fight card or competition.
- A temporary suspension from future events by [EVENT ORGANISER].
- A indefinite **permanent** suspension from all events by [EVENT ORGANISER].
